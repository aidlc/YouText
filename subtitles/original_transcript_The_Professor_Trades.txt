welcome to today's crude oil technical analysis 
video now we are starting on the monthly chart we  
are halfway through January and the one thing that 
stands out right now is that if we did a Fibonacci  
okay and we made this a little bit larger okay we 
did come to a nice area where we began selling up  
in here when we hit that on the daily time frame 
let me show you that real quick using the same FIB  
okay on the weekly time frame which happened right 
in here okay so this is interesting for a couple  
of different reasons we're going to talk about it 
in this video we're going to look at this weekly  
candle from last week which definitely became a 
bearish engulfing candle based on the previous  
weekly candle okay so again hopefully you are here 
for crude oil and you're going to get some massive  
value on this video and just as a reminder all you

focusing 100% on crude oil from how to trade it 
on the one minute time frame all the way up to  
our daily SAR strategy now before we get into 
there let's go over some of the headlines here  
that I think are going to possibly Drive crude 
oil price much lower on Friday Trump intensified  
his call for OPEC to cut oil prices trying it to 
the potential resolution of the Russ Ukraine war  
one way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop 
making so much money and drop the price of oil  
Trump remarked during his North Carolina visit 
the President also urged opec's deao leader Saudi  
Arabia to take action during the world economic 
Forum earlier in the week despite the pressure  
this is super important here so pay attention OPEC 
and delegates remain committed to their existing  
plan of raising oil production starting in April 
so let me say that again raising oil production  
when you raise oil production prices fall okay 
Giovani s I'll call them a Commodities Analyst  
at UBS just that OPEC is unlikely to alter its 
policy unless Market fundamentals shift analysts  
warn that Trump's pushed to sanction Russia 
and Iran key oil producers May hinder efforts  
to lower energy costs by tightening Global Supply 
so again a lot of this stuff is going to have some  
fundamental values but what we focus on is on the 
technical values we're aware we're listening we're  
paying attention but this does not mean that you 
cannot trade crude oil because here's the key to  
trading ready I'm going to let all of you know 
if you trade the proper lot sizes and if you're  
trading on Futures if you trade micros you will 
be very successful we have strategies for that  
you can add multiple positions you can do dollar 
cost averaging right if you're trying to hit a  
home run okay with a few thousand dollars on a 
full CL contract and it flips on you you could  
be in trouble so if you're trading Futures take my 
advice drop down a micros and watch what happens  
you can trade you can stay in trades longer and 
you can actually make more by trading less if  
you're in a regular Forex account drop your lot 
size in half especially if you feel there's a  
little volatility going and again same thing you 
can stay in trades longer trade less and make more  
money so let's go ahead now and jump right into 
do the analysis here as we begin on this weekly  
chart okay now again this candle right here is 
pretty pretty important because this candle we  
began to turn around as we hit this Fibonacci 
level right in here okay so now I'm going to  
go ahead and just get rid of those FIB levels and 
I'm going to flip it over to the Daily time frame  
okay which is right here now as we look at the 
daily time frame I think this level right here  
is a level that we are going to hit sooner than 
later right around that 7348 let's just call it  
7350 okay we can still see here that even at the 
end of the day on Friday we still see selling  
pressure okay so I am anticipating that within 
the next you know 7 to 10 days if not sooner  
we are going to take a look at 7350 and then we 
are going to see what happens when we come back  
to this level which again if you go over to your 
left has been a nice supply and demand Zone one  
two three four five to the downside six and then 
we are almost there now so we shall see what's  
going to happen on this big time frame here we are 
going to see what is going to happen around 7350  
okay if you have been in the trading club we have 
been selling since 81 80ish 81 depending on which  
or platform you are in we have been only focusing 
on sales avoiding any uprises on the market and we  
shall stay bearish on crude oil okay let me go 
over now to the eight hour chart so I can give  
you some levels that you can have okay and if you 
do not I'm going to start fresh if you do not have  
the eight hour chart okay then feel free to use 
the daily because they are very very similar so  
I want you to Mark 8050 okay I want you to Mark 
uh SE let's just call it 76 anytime you see like  
7666 just make it 7650 or so crude oil and trading 
loves those round numbers and then let's bring it  
all the way down here to this 7350 is area that 
we just talked about so we can clearly see here  
now on The 8 Hour chart that we did have a break 
of structure okay right here and we did have a  
retracement and if you look at this eight hour 
right here this is why we love bibs staying with  
the trend in what we do okay again a perfect 
bounce off that 61.8 okay okay and if there's  
somebody that tells you that Fibonacci do not work 
okay they are not 100% but if you have someone  
that tells you that Fibonacci does not work if you 
use it right and on the right scenarios come into  
our Trading Group you can use the website up above 
and see what we do with our Elliot wave analyst  
and with myself trading Fibonacci and trading 
zones you'll become a 90% successful Trader and if  
you trade with the right lot sizes where you don't 
overtrade I will get you to become a 90 to 95%  
successful Trader because we're seeing it okay so 
again Fibonacci Works under the right scenario if  
you're trading it the right way so if you have any 
questions come in and join me and let me show you  
how we use Fibonacci so we are looking here now 
we can clearly see here okay I'm going to go to  
get rid of this box here we can see here now that 
we are in this little pattern right here okay I'm  
going to make this yellow and so if we look over 
the course of the last three eight hour candles  
okay which if we go to the Daily it's basically 
the daily candle you see that right three eight  
hour candles of course that equals 24 that 
makes up one daily candle okay so we can see the  
liquidity grab off of this candle right here okay 
and so uh again we still believe there is further  
movements down and selling pressure so as we drop 
to the 4our chart now of course what's going to  
happen is we're going to see a lot more candles 
in a 4H hour chart to make up that one day candle  
so this box here is going to be interesting we'll 
be focusing in on this box right in here now I'm  
going to be bringing this blue line back up to the 
yellow okay but I'm going to leave this blue line  
here at the white line okay so when you look at 
the current price of crude oil number one is the  
reason why price came down here and those folks in 
the group will attest to it I gave you this level  
okay a week and a half ago telling you that crude 
oil was going to come down to grab the liquidity  
of that area and sure enough they've come down 
to grab 80% liquidity of that candle now don't be  
mistaken this little candle right here still has 
some unet liquidity as small as it is still has  
some unmet liquidity and then we've got this 7350 
area lingering right in here okay which I believe  
is going to come back to retest this area but for 
right now what I want you to do okay is I want you  
to focus on that Aqua Box in that chart because 
depending on the price action will depend on what  
we do with buys or sells based on that chart right 
there so I'm bringing in your trading field to a  
much much smaller area now it is very difficult 
to trade in what we call the black hole which is  
kind of this this area because if you look right 
here you can see up down up down up down unless  
you're sitting on a one minute chart and we have 
a training coming up in the group on how to trade  
the one minute chart with crude oil it is very 
difficult for you to understand the direction  
okay but let me just squeeze the chart here and 
let me just show you especially if you are brand  
new to crude oil right we can definitely see that 
we definitely have momentum to the downside right  
I think we can all agree upon that okay and if 
we look at this floor okay right in here remember  
floors are never aligned they're an area okay and 
we take a Fibonacci from where this floor began to  
the top side okay where we are now we can see here 
that we are in this area between 61 and 88 that  
we typically would look for possibly some type of 
interim short-term reversal if we're going against  
the trend we need more confirmation okay if we are 
going to break the trend to go much higher and I'm  
going to show you that now as I clear these fi 
levels so in my opinion if we're going to see  
price get back between 77 and 80 then we need to 
see this type of price action but over here so  
we would need to see a 4H hour or higher candle 
close above 77 have some type of retest if we're  
going to shoot higher okay if we're going to shoot 
higher so this we are going to call it scenario a  
if scenario a happens okay then we are going to 
go higher in pricing somewhere between 77 and 80  
and of course the price action will dictate it if 
we cannot close a 4-Hour candle above that level  
and we close a candle just below this blue box 
right just below this blue box which could be  
7450 or so again that's 100 points down to this 
next level right in here okay that we will call  
scenario B so scenario B okay in my opinion is 
more or higher probability than uh scenario a  
unless something fundamentally just happens to 
come out of the Woodworks and price shoots up okay  
but in the meantime if you are confused if you're 
trying to trade crude oil by yourself if you don't  
understand price action do not trade until you 
get either scenario a or you get scenario B now  
we in our group because we have a lot of folks 
and we have a lot of people watching charts and  
I'm losing my voice we might trade some scalps 
in either direction but we are really going to  
wait for that strong confirmation before we take 
a position to the downside or to the upside so in  
my opinion based on previous factors okay the 
best days to trade crude oil are Wednesdays  
and Thursdays because we've established possibly 
Direction even though crude oil inventories are  
usually on Wednesday it's nice to let the news 
settle then we look for structure okay structure  
and price action will always be king even over 
news okay but we just don't want to get into a  
trade right before the news okay so we will look 
for that as we dig deeper in the charts so we like  
Sunday Mondays for these charts to happen now on 
Sundays we do like to trade crude oil gaps okay  
so based on the one hour chart let me bring it 
down and we are here this is going to be the Gap  
so we know price closed here on Friday okay so 
if there is a gap okay then the Gap is going to  
function from this area now that you're on the one 
hour chart see it doesn't look too far away even  
though it's almost 100 points in both directions 
the B scenario is much closer to happening than  
the a scenario we can still see here that again we 
don't know what's going to happen with The Gap but  
we were still making right a high a low a high a 
low a high so we are still walking down lower lows  
and lower highs we have no reason to change that 
okay right now again we would have to close on a  
higher time frame above 77 okay this area right 
up here okay somewhere right up in this area to  
continue going higher okay so it's going to be 
a a little bit on the one hour you really want  
to get a candle to close above that second white 
line to reconfirm your position so we are looking  
more than likely like even though we may have a 
push up let's say on a Sunday Monday that we may  
then bounce back down to create a new low and if 
we create a new low that new low has to be created  
down here because these two were the last two lows 
right in here so the new low would have to push  
towards this 74 to 7350 area Okay so that's kind 
of the Outlook as we are approaching the end of  
this video that's kind of my take on crude oil the 
key here is not to jump into anything you don't  
know Direction on Sunday with the Market's 
open Sundays should never be a trading day  
unless you have a gap strategy okay Mondays should 
really be a day to watch price and start reading  
on the fundamentals of crude oil natural gas 
and other things that we trade on Tuesday we can  
really begin to look for structure and possibly 
look for the best trade for direction for the  
rest of the week in those scenarios okay but do 
not jump into anything on Sunday Mondays because  
they like to trap you on those days hey I hope
